  # Examples - strictly we should create this from the .env file using kubectl
  # But for declarative apporach, we can put placeholders or ask user to create it.
  # For now, I'll assume we use kustomize or kubectl create secret generic
  # But to make it work with just `kubectl apply -f k8s/`, I will add a dummy secret
  # and instructions to replace it.
  DEBUG: "True"
  # ... (It's better to create this via command line from file to avoid committing secrets)
